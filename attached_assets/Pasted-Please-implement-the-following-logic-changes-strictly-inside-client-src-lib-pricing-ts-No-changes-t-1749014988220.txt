Please implement the following logic changes strictly inside client/src/lib/pricing.ts.
No changes to UI rendering, webhook logic, form behavior, submission flow, or database schema.

All logic must be isolated to pricing calculations only.

âœ… VEHICLE TYPE RULES
1. Car/Truck/SUV Minimum Floor
No car, truck, or SUV should ever be priced below $695.

ts
Copy
Edit
if (['car', 'truck', 'suv'].includes(vehicleType.toLowerCase()) && basePrice < 695) {
  basePrice = 695;
}
2. Car/Truck/SUV Middle-Range Uplift
If the final price (after applying the $695 floor) is between $696 and $1070, increase it by 20%.

ts
Copy
Edit
if (
  ['car', 'truck', 'suv'].includes(vehicleType.toLowerCase()) &&
  basePrice >= 696 &&
  basePrice <= 1070
) {
  basePrice = Math.round(basePrice * 1.2);
}
âœ… RV-SPECIFIC LOGIC (IMPORTANT)
3. RV Minimum Price Rule
No RV move should ever be priced under $750. This is a hard minimum.

ts
Copy
Edit
if (vehicleType.toLowerCase() === 'rv' && basePrice < 750) {
  basePrice = 750;
}
4. RV Short-Distance Adjustment
If the route is under 1,500 miles, and the original base price is already â‰¥ $750, increase the price by 30%.

âœ… IMPORTANT: Do NOT apply 30% on top of the $750 minimum. The 30% uplift is only for RV quotes that were already â‰¥ $750 before applying the floor.

ts
Copy
Edit
if (vehicleType.toLowerCase() === 'rv') {
  if (basePrice < 750) {
    basePrice = 750;
  } else if (routeDistance < 1500) {
    basePrice = Math.round(basePrice * 1.3);
  }
}
ðŸ§© ORDER OF OPERATIONS (DO NOT CHANGE):
Apply minimums first:

Cars/Trucks/SUVs: $695

RVs: $750

Then apply conditional uplifts:

Car/Truck/SUV: +20% for $696â€“$1070

RVs: +30% only if already â‰¥ $750 and under 1,500 miles

âœ… Scope & Safety Disclaimer:

This logic must not touch any webhook, database field, or CRM-side module.

No changes should occur outside of pricing.ts

Vehicle type detection uses vehicleType as-is.

Route distance uses routeDistance as-is.

No backend or UI impact allowed.

Confirm complete understanding before implementing.

â˜‘ Please confirm full comprehension of the above and do not proceed with implementation unless every condition and rule is understood exactly.
