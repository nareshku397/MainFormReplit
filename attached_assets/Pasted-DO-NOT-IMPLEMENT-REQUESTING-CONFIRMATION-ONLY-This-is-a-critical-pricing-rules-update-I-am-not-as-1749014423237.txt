DO NOT IMPLEMENT — REQUESTING CONFIRMATION ONLY
This is a critical pricing rules update. I am not asking for any implementation yet.
First, I need Replit to explicitly confirm that it fully understands the logic, order of operations, and scope before any changes are made.

MASTER PRICING RULE LOGIC (CONFIRMATION REQUIRED)

Please confirm that the following 4 logic rules can be implemented strictly inside the quote calculator pricing logic, with no impact to:

UI rendering

Form validation

Database schema

Webhook logic

Submission/posting behavior

Dispatch or carrier modules

RULE 1: Cars/Trucks/SUVs Minimum Price Floor
No quote for a car, truck, or SUV should ever be below $695.

js
Copy
Edit
if (['car', 'truck', 'suv'].includes(vehicleType.toLowerCase()) && basePrice < 695) {
  basePrice = 695;
}
RULE 2: Midrange Uplift for Cars/Trucks/SUVs
If price falls between $696 and $1070 after applying the floor, increase it by 20%.

js
Copy
Edit
if (['car', 'truck', 'suv'].includes(vehicleType.toLowerCase()) && basePrice >= 696 && basePrice <= 1070) {
  basePrice = Math.round(basePrice * 1.2);
}
RULE 3: RV Minimum Price Floor
No RV quote should ever be less than $750.

js
Copy
Edit
if (vehicleType.toLowerCase() === 'rv' && basePrice < 750) {
  basePrice = 750;
}
RULE 4: RV Short-Distance Uplift
If vehicleType is rv and routeDistance < 1500, increase price by 30%.

js
Copy
Edit
if (vehicleType.toLowerCase() === 'rv' && routeDistance < 1500) {
  basePrice = Math.round(basePrice * 1.3);
}
✅ ORDER OF EXECUTION (MUST BE RESPECTED)
Apply price floor (Cars/SUVs/Trucks → $695, RVs → $750)

If vehicle is Car/Truck/SUV and in $696–$1070 range → apply 20%

If vehicle is RV and under 1500 miles → apply 30%

REPLIT CONFIRMATION NEEDED:
Before anything is implemented, I need Replit to confirm:

That the above logic is fully understood

That implementation can be safely scoped only to the quote pricing logic

That no other system will be affected

Only after confirmation will I authorize implementation.
