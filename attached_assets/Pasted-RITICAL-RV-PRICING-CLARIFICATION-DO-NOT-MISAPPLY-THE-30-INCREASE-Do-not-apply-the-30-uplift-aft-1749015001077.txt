RITICAL RV PRICING CLARIFICATION â€” DO NOT MISAPPLY THE 30% INCREASE

Do not apply the 30% uplift after setting the RV minimum to $750 unless the originally calculated price (based on mileage Ã— rate) was already â‰¥ $750.

âœ… PROPER LOGIC FLOW FOR RVs:
Start with base mileage calculation.

If basePrice < $750 â†’
â€ƒâ€ƒSet basePrice = 750 (this is the minimum floor â€” no further increases).

If basePrice â‰¥ $750 and routeDistance < 1500 â†’
â€ƒâ€ƒThen apply 30% uplift: basePrice *= 1.3.

ðŸ§± Why this matters:
The 30% uplift is meant only for short-distance RV moves that naturally priced over $750.
If we apply 30% to the minimum, weâ€™d be overcharging RVs that were supposed to get bumped just to the floor â€” thatâ€™s a pricing failure.

âœ… Final Rule (in code):
ts
Copy
Edit
if (vehicleType.toLowerCase() === 'rv') {
  if (basePrice < 750) {
    basePrice = 750;
  } else if (routeDistance < 1500) {
    basePrice = Math.round(basePrice * 1.3);
  }
}
â˜‘ Confirm understanding and hold off on implementation unless this logic is fully grasped.

Here is the full master instructional prompt to send to Replit, with all final pricing rules and the corrected RV clarification included. This is written exactly as a senior developer should send it â€” strict, scoped, and with disclaimers:

ðŸ§± MASTER PRICING RULES IMPLEMENTATION â€” ABSOLUTELY NO SIDE EFFECTS

Please implement the following logic changes strictly inside client/src/lib/pricing.ts.
No changes to UI rendering, webhook logic, form behavior, submission flow, or database schema.

All logic must be isolated to pricing calculations only.

âœ… VEHICLE TYPE RULES
1. Car/Truck/SUV Minimum Floor
No car, truck, or SUV should ever be priced below $695.

ts
Copy
Edit
if (['car', 'truck', 'suv'].includes(vehicleType.toLowerCase()) && basePrice < 695) {
  basePrice = 695;
}
2. Car/Truck/SUV Middle-Range Uplift
If the final price (after applying the $695 floor) is between $696 and $1070, increase it by 20%.

ts
Copy
Edit
if (
  ['car', 'truck', 'suv'].includes(vehicleType.toLowerCase()) &&
  basePrice >= 696 &&
  basePrice <= 1070
) {
  basePrice = Math.round(basePrice * 1.2);
}
âœ… RV-SPECIFIC LOGIC (IMPORTANT)
3. RV Minimum Price Rule
No RV move should ever be priced under $750. This is a hard minimum.

ts
Copy
Edit
if (vehicleType.toLowerCase() === 'rv' && basePrice < 750) {
  basePrice = 750;
}
4. RV Short-Distance Adjustment
If the route is under 1,500 miles, and the original base price is already â‰¥ $750, increase the price by 30%.

âœ… IMPORTANT: Do NOT apply 30% on top of the $750 minimum. The 30% uplift is only for RV quotes that were already â‰¥ $750 before applying the floor.

ts
Copy
Edit
if (vehicleType.toLowerCase() === 'rv') {
  if (basePrice < 750) {
    basePrice = 750;
  } else if (routeDistance < 1500) {
    basePrice = Math.round(basePrice * 1.3);
  }
}
ðŸ§© ORDER OF OPERATIONS (DO NOT CHANGE):
Apply minimums first:

Cars/Trucks/SUVs: $695

RVs: $750

Then apply conditional uplifts:

Car/Truck/SUV: +20% for $696â€“$1070

RVs: +30% only if already â‰¥ $750 and under 1,500 miles

âœ… Scope & Safety Disclaimer:

This logic must not touch any webhook, database field, or CRM-side module.

No changes should occur outside of pricing.ts

Vehicle type detection uses vehicleType as-is.

Route distance uses routeDistance as-is.

No backend or UI impact allowed.

Confirm complete understanding before implementing.

â˜‘ Please confirm full comprehension of the above and do not proceed with implementation unless every condition and rule is understood exactly.
