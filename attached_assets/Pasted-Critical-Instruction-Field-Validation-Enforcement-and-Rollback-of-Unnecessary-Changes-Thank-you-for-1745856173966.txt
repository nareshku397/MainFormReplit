Critical Instruction: Field Validation Enforcement and Rollback of Unnecessary Changes
Thank you for setting up the diagnostics system.
Please now update the validation system according to the following corrected and final requirements:

üìã Actions Required
‚úÖ 1. Enforce Validation for These New Required Fields (previously missing validation):

Pickup City

Pickup State

Pickup Zip

Dropoff City

Dropoff State

Dropoff Zip

‚úÖ 2. Continue Enforcing Validation for These Existing Fields (already validated previously):

Contact Info Name (must be non-empty)

Contact Info Email (must be valid email format)

Contact Info Phone (must be valid phone number format)

Vehicle Year (must be a valid 4-digit year)

Vehicle Make (must be non-empty)

Vehicle Model (must be non-empty)

Shipment Date (must be a valid date format)

‚úÖ 3. ROLL BACK and REMOVE any additional, recently added validation that was not approved:

Remove any validation rules that block or reject submissions beyond the above listed fields.

Erase any validation for optional fields or new rules that were not explicitly requested.

Erase any newly introduced over-aggressive validation that caused good submissions to fail.

Restore validation behavior strictly to what is listed above ‚Äî nothing more.

‚úÖ 4. Validation Behavior Required:

Block the form submission if any required fields are missing or invalid.

Display a clear, user-friendly error message indicating exactly which field must be corrected.

Only allow webhook transmission to Zapier after 100% of required fields pass validation.

Allow all otherwise valid submissions to proceed without interference.

üîí CRITICAL DISCLAIMER
‚ö†Ô∏è Do not modify webhook structure, database schema, CRM mappings, or production data.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not restructure form fields or backend models.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only correct the form submission validation logic exactly as described above.

üéØ Final Goal
Guarantee that every customer submission includes complete and properly validated required fields.

Prevent accidental rejection of good submissions.

Protect customer experience and data flow to Zapier and CRM without over-blocking.
