Implementation Scope for Form App: Capture Facebook/Meta Attribution from Parent Page (iframe)
📋 Situation
The Form App is embedded inside an iframe on the landing page.

The landing page URL contains important tracking parameters (fbclid, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, etc.) from Facebook/Meta ads.

The Form App does not currently capture these parameters.

This is causing Meta server events (CAPI quote_sent) to lose attribution and break ad tracking.

📋 Actions Required
✅ 1. In the Form App frontend (e.g., in QuoteOptions.jsx or wherever form submission is handled):

Safely read the parent page URL:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const parentUrl = window.parent?.location?.href || "";
✅ 2. Extract tracking parameters from the parent URL:

javascript
Copy
Edit
function getQueryParam(name, url) {
  const match = url.match(new RegExp('[?&]' + name + '=([^&]+)'));
  return match ? decodeURIComponent(match[1]) : null;
}

const fbclid = getQueryParam('fbclid', parentUrl);
const utm_source = getQueryParam('utm_source', parentUrl);
const utm_medium = getQueryParam('utm_medium', parentUrl);
const utm_campaign = getQueryParam('utm_campaign', parentUrl);
const utm_term = getQueryParam('utm_term', parentUrl);
const utm_content = getQueryParam('utm_content', parentUrl);
✅ 3. Extend the existing formData that is submitted with these parameters:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const formData = {
  ...existingFormData,
  fbclid,
  utm_source,
  utm_medium,
  utm_campaign,
  utm_term,
  utm_content
};
✅ 4. Submit this enriched formData to the backend /api/send-quote-notification as part of the existing quote creation flow.

✅ 5. Do not change any existing fields, validations, webhook structures, or database mappings.

✅ 6. Ensure that if the attribution parameters are missing from the parent URL:

The form still submits normally without errors.

No impact on the customer experience.

🔒 CRITICAL NON-NEGOTIABLE CONDITIONS
⚠️ Do not modify or restructure database schemas, CRM mappings, webhook endpoints, or stored quote fields.

⚠️ Only capture attribution parameters from the parent page and enrich the frontend form submission.

⚠️ No structural changes to backend quote models, CRM tables, or live production data.

🎯 Goal
Capture Facebook/Meta tracking parameters reliably inside the iframe environment.

Pass these parameters along with quote submissions to the backend.

Allow Meta CAPI server events to receive proper attribution for accurate ad tracking.

Ensure no impact or disruption to existing customer flow or production stability.
