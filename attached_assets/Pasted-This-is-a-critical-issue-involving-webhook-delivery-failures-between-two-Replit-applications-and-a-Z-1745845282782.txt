This is a critical issue involving webhook delivery failures between two Replit applications and a Zapier endpoint.

🚨 Situation Summary
A customer submits a form on our landing page.

The form app (hosted on Replit) collects customer, vehicle, and route information.

The form app sends an HTTP POST request (application/json) to a Zapier webhook:
https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/18240296/20zu8bj/

Zapier is supposed to receive the payload and push it into our second Replit CRM app.

Recently, webhook transmissions are intermittently failing. Symptoms:

502 Bad Gateway errors from Zapier.

503 Service Unavailable errors from Zapier.

Some leads missing in CRM.

Some form submissions succeed normally.

📋 Required from Replit Diagnostic
Log every outbound webhook POST request payload and associated HTTP response code + response body from Zapier.

Confirm that the form app's fetch call:

Properly uses await.

Waits for Zapier's full response before completing.

Measure and log the payload size in bytes before transmission.

Capture any timeout, connection reset, or transmission error logs at the application layer.

Analyze if the Replit app’s outbound traffic or server response times are causing webhook instability.

🛠️ Specific Areas Replit Must Investigate
Confirm that webhook POSTs are not dropped, half-sent, or timing out inside the Replit app.

Confirm that large payloads are not exceeding Replit execution limits.

Confirm that the app is properly handling slow or failed responses from Zapier without prematurely closing or crashing requests.

Confirm that Zapier 502/503 errors are not correlated to Replit server-side network congestion or downtime.

🔒 Constraints
Do not modify the database models, form field structure, or CRM receiving app.

Do not modify the Zapier Zap.

Only investigate and confirm transmission integrity from the sending Replit app to Zapier endpoint.

📈 Deliverables Requested
Logs of at least 10 webhook attempts (both successful and failed).

Confirmation whether transmission failures originate inside the Replit app, in transit, or after handoff to Zapier.

Diagnostic timeline for resolution if issues are found at the Replit layer.
