Understanding the Issue
The form will be embedded as an iframe in the main site, which means the container of the iframe will need to be responsive itself. However, it's crucial to ensure that everything inside the iframe—like the checkout page and thank-you page—is properly resized based on the device.

The form before submission (customer details, transport selection, etc.) can stay as-is. The focus is on:

Price display page: Showing dynamic pricing based on user selections.

Checkout page: Where the user confirms the details and submits.

Thank-you page: Confirmation of the successful reservation.

Steps to Ensure Proper Size & Responsiveness After Submission:
1. Understanding the Iframe Structure
Since this form will be embedded within an iframe, the iframe itself must be responsive to adapt to varying screen sizes.

Make sure the iframe's parent container (the one on the main website) is responsive.

The iframe element should have width="100%" and height="100%" to adjust dynamically.

Example:

html
Copy
<iframe
  src="yourformURL"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>
Inside the iframe, you want everything to adjust responsively based on screen size.

2. Using CSS for the Pages After Submission (Price Display, Checkout, and Thank You)
The core problem you mentioned is ensuring that the pages after submission (price display, checkout, and thank-you page) resize properly for mobile and desktop views.

Use flexible layouts and media queries inside the iframe’s content to ensure responsiveness. You can set up rules to adjust font size, padding, margins, and element positioning based on screen size.

For example:

Price display and checkout pages should have a flexible layout, with content stacking vertically on smaller devices and horizontally on larger ones.

Thank-you page should be easy to read on any device, with minimal padding and well-sized elements.

Example CSS for responsiveness inside the iframe:

css
Copy
/* Basic container for the iframe content */
.container {
  max-width: 100%; /* Ensures full width */
  padding: 20px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Media query for small devices (mobile) */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .price-card {
    width: 100%; /* Stack cards for mobile */
    font-size: 16px; /* Adjust text size for mobile */
  }

  .thank-you-message {
    font-size: 14px; /* Smaller text for smaller screens */
  }
}

/* For medium-sized devices (tablet) */
@media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .price-card {
    width: 45%; /* Two-column layout for tablets */
    font-size: 18px;
  }

  .thank-you-message {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
}

/* For larger screens (desktops) */
@media (min-width: 1025px) {
  .price-card {
    width: 30%; /* Three-column layout for desktop */
    font-size: 20px;
  }

  .thank-you-message {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}
3. Ensuring Dynamic Content Inside the Iframe (Price, Selection, Confirmation)
After the user submits their details, the form content (price, transport type, etc.) should dynamically update based on the user's choices.

Here’s how to handle dynamic content and responsiveness for different screen sizes:

Price Display Page:

Cards for Transport Options (Open vs. Enclosed): These should dynamically change prices when toggling, and their size should adapt to fit different screen sizes.

Mobile: Cards should stack vertically.

Desktop: Cards should display side by side.

Checkout Page:

Pre-filled customer info should appear, and the form fields for pickup/dropoff details should be easy to read on both mobile and desktop.

For mobile users, ensure buttons are large enough to tap, and input fields are properly sized.

Thank-You Page:

The thank-you message and reservation confirmation should be centered and not overcrowded. Font size should be adjusted for readability on smaller screens.

4. Testing Responsiveness with Replit
Here’s how you can ensure the form and pages inside the iframe render perfectly across devices in Replit:

Use the Replit Preview:

Check your iframe inside the preview window. This will help you simulate how the form will look on both desktop and mobile.

Resize the preview window manually or use device emulation mode in the browser’s dev tools (like Chrome DevTools) to see the responsiveness.

Test Form in Iframe:

Ensure the form submission, price display, checkout, and thank-you pages scale properly on both mobile and desktop.

On desktop, check that the layout stays aligned, and on mobile, ensure no horizontal scroll or content overflow.

5. Debugging Common Issues
Content Overflow: Ensure padding and margins do not cause content to overflow off the screen.

Font Size: Adjust font size dynamically to maintain readability on both large and small screens.

Buttons and Inputs: Ensure form controls like buttons, dropdowns, and text fields are easy to interact with on mobile by adjusting padding and height.

6. Replit Customization and Debugging
If you're using Replit to preview and deploy this iframe form, consider these tips:

Test form interactions on different devices.

Use custom CSS to ensure that elements are responsive and don’t overlap.

Optimize images for faster load times, particularly on mobile.

Adjust iframe height dynamically based on the content length to prevent unnecessary scrolling.

Final Thoughts
The goal here is to ensure that after submission, the pricing display, checkout, and thank-you pages inside the iframe remain fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

By using CSS Grid/Flexbox, media queries, and dynamic resizing, we can ensure these pages look great on all devices. Testing inside Replit with emulators or real devices will help to confirm proper scaling and functionality.
