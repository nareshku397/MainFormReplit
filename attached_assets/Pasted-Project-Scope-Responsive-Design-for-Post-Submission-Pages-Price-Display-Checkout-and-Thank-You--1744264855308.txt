Project Scope: Responsive Design for Post-Submission Pages (Price Display, Checkout, and Thank-You)
Disclaimer:
The front-side view of the form, where the user inputs their name, phone, email, etc., is fine and does not require immediate attention for mobile responsiveness. Our focus right now is solely on everything after the user submits their details, including the price display page, checkout page, and the thank-you page. These pages need to be properly sized for both desktop and mobile views.

1. Responsive Design Goals:
The main objective is to ensure that the price display, checkout, and thank-you pages are optimized for both mobile and desktop devices. These pages need to resize dynamically based on the user's screen size to provide an optimal experience.

Key Requirements:
Price Display Page: This page shows the total price, transit time, and transport options.

Checkout Page: This is where the user confirms their details and proceeds to the final confirmation.

Thank-You Page: After the reservation is complete, the user will see a confirmation message.

Note: We are not concerned with the form entry page for now (where users input their name, phone, email, and other basic details). That is handled already.
2. Responsive Layout Techniques:
CSS Flexbox and Grid:
To ensure a responsive layout, we will use CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid. These layout techniques allow us to create flexible, fluid designs that adapt to various screen sizes.

Flexbox:
For mobile screens: Use flex-direction: column to stack the elements vertically.

For desktop screens: Use flex-direction: row to arrange elements in a horizontal row.

CSS Grid:
Use CSS Grid for complex layouts where you have more than one dimension (i.e., rows and columns).

Example:
css
Copy
/* For mobile */
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 16px;
  width: 100%;
}

/* For desktop */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    gap: 30px;
  }
}
3. Use Media Queries for Responsiveness:
Media queries will help adjust the layout based on the screen size. For example, on mobile, you want fields to stack vertically, while on desktop, they can be arranged horizontally.

Example for Media Queries:
css
Copy
/* Default for Mobile (smaller screens) */
.form-container {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 16px;
}

/* Tablet and Desktop */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .form-container {
    width: 80%;
    padding: 20px;
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}

/* Large Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .form-container {
    width: 60%;
    padding: 30px;
    font-size: 20px;
  }
}
This ensures that the form is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Elements will adjust their size and position depending on the screen width.

4. Handling the Price Display, Checkout, and Thank-You Pages:
After the user submits their information, the price display, checkout, and thank-you pages need to resize properly for both mobile and desktop views. Here's how you can adjust the layout:

Price Display Page:
On mobile: Use a single column layout to display price and transport options.

On desktop: You can show multiple transport options side by side.

Checkout Page:
On mobile: Stack the form fields vertically, making sure the buttons and form fields are touch-friendly.

On desktop: You can spread the content out with larger margins for better use of space.

Thank-You Page:
On mobile: Use larger fonts and bigger buttons for easy tap interactions.

On desktop: Space out the content for clarity, but avoid making it too wide.

5. Testing for Mobile and Desktop Views:
You need to test the responsiveness of these pages on multiple devices and screen sizes:

Use Browser Developer Tools:

In Chrome, right-click on the page, click Inspect, then toggle the device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M). This simulates various screen sizes.

Test on Real Devices:

Always test on real mobile and desktop devices to see how the layout behaves.

Adjust Font Sizes Dynamically:

Ensure font sizes adjust based on screen size using relative units like em or rem.

6. Handling the Iframe for Embedding:
If you plan to embed this form inside an iframe on another website (such as WordPress), make sure the iframe resizes dynamically based on the content inside it. You can do this by adjusting the iframe's height to match the content.

Example:

javascript
Copy
// Automatically resize iframe based on content
window.addEventListener("load", function () {
  var iframe = document.getElementById("myIframe");
  iframe.height = iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + "px";
});
This ensures that the iframe will adjust as content changes, providing a seamless experience.

7. Best Practices for Handling Form Layout:
Fluid Grids: Use percentage-based widths (%) for containers, inputs, and buttons so they scale correctly.

Avoid Fixed Widths: Never use pixel-based widths (e.g., width: 500px) for responsiveness.

Use Relative Units: Prefer units like em, rem, vh, vw, or % to ensure proper scaling.

Font Size: Make sure text is legible on all screen sizes. Use relative units for fonts.

css
Copy
body {
  font-size: 1rem; /* Base font size */
}
8. Additional Debugging Tips:
To ensure proper scaling and resolution for both mobile and desktop, follow these steps:

Viewport Meta Tag: Ensure that the viewport meta tag is set up correctly:

html
Copy
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Use Relative Spacing:

For margins, paddings, and spacing between form elements, use relative units (e.g., em, %).

Avoid Fixed Layouts:

Do not use fixed-width or fixed-height styles for elements. Use flexible layouts instead.

Proper Button Sizing:

Make sure the buttons are large enough for easy interaction on mobile devices. Use large tap targets (e.g., 44px height).

Avoid Horizontal Scrolling:

Ensure that elements do not overflow horizontally, especially on mobile devices.

Test With Different Screen Sizes:

Simulate on both small (mobile) and large (desktop) screens using emulators or physical devi
