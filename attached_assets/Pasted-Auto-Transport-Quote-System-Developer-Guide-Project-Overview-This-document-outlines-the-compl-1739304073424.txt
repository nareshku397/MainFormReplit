Auto Transport Quote System – Developer Guide
📌 Project Overview
This document outlines the complete logic, pricing structure, UI/UX elements, API integrations, and functionalities for the Auto Transport Quote System. The system will be integrated into quote-form-two.vercel.app to provide fast, accurate, and user-friendly transport quotes.

🖥️ Customer Page Requirements

Other (Manually Entered by Customer)
2️⃣ Make & Model Dropdown (For Cars, SUVs, and Pickup Trucks)
If a customer selects Car, SUV, or Pickup Truck, a second dropdown appears to select:
Make (e.g., Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet)
Model (e.g., Camry, F-150, Silverado)
3️⃣ Manually Entered Vehicle Types
For all other vehicle types, the customer must manually enter details:

⚙️ Pricing Logic
1️⃣ Distance-Based Pricing (For Sedans, SUVs, Pickup Trucks)
0–499 miles: No price is displayed; instead, the user is redirected to a thank-you page:
“Thank you! Your request has been received. Our team will contact you soon with a confirmed price.”
500–800 miles: $0.614 per mile + 10% margin
801+ miles: $0.614 per mile
Minimum price for any route: $450

2️⃣ Vehicle Type Adjustments
SUVs:
Under 1,600 miles: +25% over sedan price
Over 1,600 miles: +7.5% over sedan price
Pickup Trucks:
+28.9% over sedan price
Enclosed pickup truck transport: 20% higher than enclosed SUV transport
All manually entered vehicle types → Pricing requires a custom quote. The user is redirected to a thank-you page for follow-up.

3️⃣ Open vs. Enclosed Transport
Open transport: Base price
Enclosed transport: +40% increase over open transport price

4️⃣ Seasonal Pricing Adjustments (Applied Automatically, Not Shown to Customer)
Southbound (October–March) → +35% increase
Northbound (April–September) → +35% increase
This adjustment is calculated automatically but will NOT be displayed or mentioned to the customer.

🛣️ Distance Calculation – Google Maps API or Mapbox API
The system will use Google Maps API or Mapbox API to calculate mileage between the pickup and drop-off locations.

📍 Code for Fetching Distance Data
Google Maps API
javascript
CopyEdit
const getDistanceGoogle = async (pickup, dropoff) => {
  const API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY";
  const url = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?origins=${pickup}&destinations=${dropoff}&key=${API_KEY}`;
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.rows[0].elements[0].status === "OK") {
      return {
        distance: Math.round(data.rows[0].elements[0].distance.value / 1609.34), // Convert meters to miles
      };
    } else {
      throw new Error("Distance calculation failed");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Google Maps API Error:", error);
    return null;
  }
};


🚚 Transit Time Calculation
Transit time is calculated as distance ÷ 400 miles per day.
javascript
CopyEdit
const calculateTransitTime = (distance) => {
  return Math.ceil(distance / 400); // Round up to the nearest whole day
};


💰 Full Pricing Calculation Function
javascript
CopyEdit
const calculateQuote = async (pickup, dropoff, vehicleType, transportType, date) => {
  const routeData = await getDistanceGoogle(pickup, dropoff);  
  if (!routeData) return null;

  let basePrice = routeData.distance * 0.614;

  // Apply vehicle type adjustments
  if (vehicleType === "suv") {
    basePrice *= routeData.distance < 1600 ? 1.25 : 1.075;
  } else if (vehicleType === "pickup") {
    basePrice *= 1.289;
  }

  // Apply seasonal pricing adjustment (not shown to customer)
  const month = new Date(date).getMonth() + 1; // Get the month (1-12)
  if (month >= 10 || month <= 3) {
    basePrice *= 1.35; // Southbound pricing increase
  } else if (month >= 4 && month <= 9) {
    basePrice *= 1.35; // Northbound pricing increase
  }

  // Adjust for enclosed transport
  if (transportType === "enclosed") {
    basePrice *= 1.4;
    if (vehicleType === "pickup") basePrice *= 1.2;
  }

  return { 
    price: basePrice.toFixed(2), 
    transitTime: calculateTransitTime(routeData.distance) 
  };
};
