Problem Summary (What You Described)
After the user completes the form, the screen behaves strangely â€” it looks like it's "trying to render something," but doesn't finish cleanly. The result is visually painful, clunky, or broken.

ðŸ©º Likely Causes (Technical Diagnosis)
1. Missing or Incomplete Final State
If youâ€™re using React (or any JS framework), and the form doesnâ€™t cleanly redirect or display a clear confirmation, it may hang on an undefined or broken state:

No "Thank You" screen

No redirect handler

Just tries to re-render the form or gets stuck

âœ… Fix: Ensure the final screen is a dedicated component or route that cleanly replaces the form view when submission is complete.

2. Page Is Re-rendering the Form Again (Without Reset)
Sometimes the form component itself is being rendered again after submission without clearing state â€” so it reloads with broken or undefined input values.

âœ… Fix: After submission, either:

Redirect to a new route (/thank-you)

Or show a Success component that unmounts the form

3. Unexpected Redirect or Network Lag
If you're doing fetch() or Axios POST on submit, and there's no loading state or delay handling, the user sees an awkward flash or partial re-render as the network request completes.

âœ… Fix: Add a proper loading spinner (isLoading state), and only show the next screen once submission is complete.

4. Form Still in Mobile-Size Iframe, but Trying to Load Something Desktop-Sized
If your confirmation page or redirect loads a layout not styled for mobile dimensions, it will look broken or painfully squeezed inside your 390px iframe.

âœ… Fix:

The confirmation screen must match the same fixed mobile width as the form

All routing inside the iframe must preserve this constraint

âœ… How to Fix This in Plain Terms
Confirm youâ€™re showing a clean, static confirmation page or success message inside the same mobile frame

Do not re-show the form after submission

Avoid full page reloads â€” just replace the form component with a visual success screen

Test inside the actual iframe environment â€” not just your dev view
